# Low-Level Design — Interview Prep

A collection of classic LLD problems solved in Python, scoped for a **45-minute interview round**. Each folder contains a `design.py` with the implementation and a `Readme.md` with the problem description, scope, and patterns used.

## Common Design Patterns Across Problems

| Pattern | Where It Appears |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Strategy** | Payment methods (Car Rental, Parking Lot), player input (Snake, Tic Tac Toe), elevator scheduling, rate limiter algorithms, expense splitting (Splitwise) |
| **Factory** | Vehicle creation (Car Rental, Parking Lot), piece creation (Chess), player creation (Snake, Tic Tac Toe), rate limiter creation |
| **Observer** | Booking notifications (Car Rental), floor display (Elevator), game state changes (Tic Tac Toe), balance updates (Splitwise) |
| **Singleton** | System entry point (Car Rental), Board (Chess), FileSystem |
| **Template Method** | Piece movement validation (Chess), snake move handling (Snake) |
| **Composite** | File/Directory hierarchy (File System) |
| **Command** | Elevator requests (Elevator) |
| **FIFO Deque + Lazy Deletion** | O(1) amortised token expiry (Resource Lease System) |
| **Threading Lock** | Thread-safe token grant / release (Resource Lease System, Rate Limiter, Movie Booking System) |
| **Provider (Abstract Factory variant)** | Pluggable lock backend (Movie Booking System) |

## How to Use

1. Pick a problem and read its `Readme.md` for scope and interview strategy.
2. Open `design.py` — code is ordered top-down (enums → models → services → orchestrator).
3. Look for `# TODO:` comments — these mark features intentionally left out of scope for a 45-min round but worth mentioning verbally to the interviewer.
4. Practice explaining class relationships and pattern choices out loud — that's what interviewers evaluate.
